# jgdm_mobile_hamburger_menu   v1.2

## Project Setup instructions

+ Setup for a mobile website with a hamburger menu

+ Using jQuery for mobile menu toggling for now.

+ Menu toggles from top

+ Mobile menu kicks in at ```980px``` width breakpoint.

+ The hamburger menu uses a class of "```ham```" which allows it to be selected by JavaScript and styled by CSS.

+ The main navigation it affects is an unordered list with the class of "```main_menu```". 

+ Beyond this, you can feel free to change the design as you see fit and I hope this will help you on your way.
