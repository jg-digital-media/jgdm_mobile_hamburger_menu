# jgdm_mobile_hamburger_menu   v1.3



## Project Setup instructions

+ Setup for a mobile website with a hamburger menu

+ Using jQuery for mobile menu toggling for now.

+ This project is setup, by default for using the SASS precompiler for CSS. In your command prompt or Terminal, type the following in the project root.  ```sass --watch sass.scss:styles.css```

+ The menuMenu toggles from top left. It does not affect the position of the page contents.

+ Mobile menu comes into effect at the ```980px``` width breakpoint.

+ The hamburger menu uses a class of "```ham```" which allows it to be selected by JavaScript and styled by CSS.

+ The main navigation it affects is an unordered list with the class of "```main_menu```". 

+ Beyond this, you can feel free to change the design as you see fit. But I hope this will help give you a start to your next project.
