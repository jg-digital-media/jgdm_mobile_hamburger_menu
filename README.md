# jgdm_mobile_hamburger_menu  **Last Update:** 06 September 2024 - 11:49 (v1.5)



## Project Setup instructions

+ In your Command Line Interface (CLI) or Terminal, ```cd``` to a project root directory and then clone the repository using ```git clone https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm_php_boilerplate```

+ Setup for a mobile website with a hamburger menu

+ Using jQuery for mobile menu toggling for now.

+ This project is setup, by default for use with the SASS precompiler for CSS. In your CLI or Terminal, type the following in the project root.  ```sass --watch sass.scss:styles.css```

+ The navigation menu toggles from top left. It does not affect the position of the page contents.

+ Mobile menu comes into effect at the ```980px``` width breakpoint.

+ The hamburger menu uses a class of "```.ham```" which allows it to be selected by JavaScript and styled by CSS.

+ The main navigation itself is an unordered list with the class of "```main_menu```". 

+ Beyond this, you can feel free to change the design as you see fit. But I hope this will help give you a start to your next project.
